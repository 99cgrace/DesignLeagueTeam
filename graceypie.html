    This project is important to me because it is motivation for change. In today's society, carelessly littering is very normalized, despite the effects we have all seen on our planet. By creating games (for change), it sheds a new light to recycling and helping our planet stay clean. This game makes cleaning our streets seem more fun and enjoyable, therefore appealing to our audience.
    So far, I have helped my team create sketches for our game, each of us doing 2 screens. I have also come up with colors and fonts to use in our game.
